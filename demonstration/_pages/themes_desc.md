It's generated by [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) which we use to highlighting code syntax, but we have some adjustment, so if you'd like to have original style, you can check every theme's detail in command after install Rouge :

```bash
# list available themes :
rougify help style

# output particular theme's css :
rougify style [style-name-here] --scope=.your_root_css\ .your_branch_css\ .highlight
```
